# Deutsche eMark [DEM] - For Windows On Windows #

Building for Win32 on Windows:
====================
This build process uses a vcxproj to build and manages dependencies with vcpkg

## Tools used ##
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/

## Build process
 1) Open the emark-cli.vcxproj file @ src/emark-cli.vcxproj
 2) Build and run

### Notes on implementation ###
  - Several typedefs implemented to attempt to maintain non-msc-compiler support
  - Logical changes for compatability with Win32
  - Update usages of boost where deprecated
 
### Version 2.1.0 ###
  - The obsolete Alert System was removed and deactivated, as it represented a central point of failure.
  - Added DNS Seeders ( fixes #86 )
  - fixed bug preventing setting a tranaction comment via RPC ( fixes #81 )
  - made code compilation compatible with newer Linux versions including Ubuntu 22.04

### Version 2.0.1 ###
  A vulnerability introduced in version 1.3 was exploited and wreaked havoc in the DEM-blockchain.
  This build contains a patch of that vulnerability. In the same time it causes a Hardfork where the chainparameters are slightly changed:
  - The POW reward is halved to 25 DEM per block
  - halving will repeat after each 500.000 blocks
  - Network/chain parameters are changed to avoid interference with the old software
  - For the same reason The RPC port has changed

  All the hacks that occured propagated in the blockchain. All outputs from these hacks however could be tainted and were put on a list of tainted unspend outputs. All DEM that originated from the hacks but were sold (about 8M) were excluded from the taint-procedure. A provision in the new chain was made to duplicate all not tainted unspend outputs to the new chain. 20M eMark from the hack is reserved for representatives of the Deutche eMark community to enhance DEM development and marketing.

### Version 1.6.1 ###
  DNS Servers track active eMark nodes in real-time and,
  when queried, they give back a short list of the best nodes to connect to.
- Adds two DNS Servers:
1. dnsseed.deutsche-emark.cc	NOTE: the Top-Level Domain (TLD) is  '.CC' for "Crypto Currency"
1. dnsseed.emarks.cc	

 - Also adds some static hard-coded nodes as backup
 
### Version 1.6.0 ###
- Openssl v 1.1 support
- fix boost-1.66 incompatibilities
- Support boost 1.70

### Version 1.5.0 ###
- Lots of Security Patches
- Compatibility with newest Packages
- Update ProcessGetData for MerkleHashes on upcoming Android QT
- faster Blockchainsync
- nStakeMaxAge removed for staking Coins >2 Years
- StakeSplit set to 10000 DEM
- Orphan Blocks massivly REDUCED ! ( tested 1 Week with lots of POW/POS Wallets running simultaneously)
- new Nodes and Checkpoints
- TX Comments will shown up in QT Wallet

### Version 1.4.0: Hardfork 15.05.2016 00.00.00 GMT 
A reload the blockchain is necessary.
Vesion < 1.4.0 will no longer work.

### Version 1.3.0: support LevelDB 
(you must reload DB, if you donÂ´t want, version 1.1.0 works fine (BerkleyDB). Download [from here](https://github.com/emarkproject/DEM/releases ))
do not use Version 1.2.x. You can loose Coins

### eMark specification ###
- SHA256D, Proof of Work + Proof of Stake
- max 210 Million Proof of Work Coins
- 3.8% annual stake per year, 30 Days Coin-Age required
- 50 coins per block
- 2 minute block targets
- 100 blocks to coin maturation
- 140 Character Transaction Messaging

### Mandatory Wallet Update ###
### from 1415750400; // 12 Nov 2014 00:00:00 GMT ###
### Wallet Version V1.0.x no longer work ###
